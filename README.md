This repository is the front-end (client-side) for a fishing configurator in which users can create, edit, or delete their own customized fishing gear setups. Each gear setup consists of a rod, reel, and tackle.

The biggest issue I had during this project was to ensure that the index feature would work for a single signed in user while not showing EVERY user's index.  I accomplished this with lots of help from my classmates and eventually got that index to work.

Addtionally, I had forgotten during my initial submittal to clear the update, create, and delete gear forms after success.  When a new user would sign in, those forms would still be filled in with the previous data.  This was easily fixed with three lines of code that reset these forms.
